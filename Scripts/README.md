All scripts created to perform analysis and generate figures for the thesis are placed here. BERTopic_Modeling and LDA_Topic_Modelling represent the main topic modelling scripts used, with each script corresponding to a different topic modelling algorithm. Measuring_Polarization_JS_and_GJS_Divergence uses the outputs of the two topic modelling scripts to generate figures based on the Jensen-Shannon Divergences and Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergences measured in the two topic modelling scripts.


42nd Parliament Analysis was only used for the interim report, and only uses data from the 42nd parliament (2015-2019).

All scripts were run on Google Colab in April 2023.
